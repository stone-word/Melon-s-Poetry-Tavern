Welcome to Melon's Poetry Tavern. This is currently a rough, small desktop idle game. Open the webpage, and you’ll see a busy little tavern. Your task is not to mix drinks, earn money, hire waitstaff, or expand… Instead, as a special customer (the little blue figure), you want to talk poetry with everyone here!

I’ve given each green ordinary customer their own identity and traits. They will chat with you using DeepSeek, and after hearing their stories, you can write a poem for them.

Sitting in the lower left corner is a special little yellow figure—the tavern’s resident poet. Recently, the resident poet is a young poet named Wang Zigua, but in a few days, it might be someone else. By talking with the resident poet, he will share a few lines of poetry he once wrote with you. You can also write a poem for him.

In the current version, all the poems you write in the tavern will be saved in a local file and downloaded. In the future, I plan to try saving them in the cloud. And when you’ve written enough poems, you might even take a seat in that corner as the resident poet.

Enjoy the poetry!

欢迎来到梅隆的诗歌酒馆（Melon's Poetry Tavern）。这是一个目前还很粗糙的桌面放置小游戏。打开网页，你可以看到一个忙碌的小酒馆，你的任务不是调酒、赚钱、雇佣服务员、扩张……而是作为一个特别的顾客（蓝色的小人），你想要和这里的所有人谈谈诗歌！

1、我给每个绿色的普通顾客设置了身份特性，它们将使用deepseek与你交谈，你可以在听了他们的故事之后为他们写一首诗。

2、左下角坐着一位特殊的小黄人，他是这家酒店的驻店诗人。最近，驻店诗人是一位叫王子瓜的青年诗人，过几天也许会换成其他人。通过与驻店诗人交谈，他会把他曾经写过的几句诗送给你。你也可以为他写一首诗。

3、在目前的版本中，你在酒馆里写的所有诗都将存储在一个本地文件中被下载下来。以后我将尝试保存在云端，并且当你的诗已经足够多，你也可能作为驻店诗人坐在那个角落。

享受诗歌吧！
