Mellon's Poetry Tavern Version 1.0.2 is officially released! Let’s celebrate Christmas together!

This version includes minor visual upgrades and adds or modifies many details. The biggest update is the introduction of a cloud database: when players interact with NPCs or write poems, their poems will be automatically uploaded to the cloud and displayed in the Poetry Library within the game.

【!! Important Notes !!】

There is currently no formal user login system, so the author information for poems is entirely based on the name you enter yourself.

Users currently do not have permission to delete their data. If you really need to delete a poem you have published, please contact me.

================

Welcome to Mellon's Poetry Tavern. This is currently a simple desktop idle game. Open the webpage, and you’ll see a bustling little tavern. Your task is not to mix drinks, earn money, hire waitstaff, or expand the business… but to play as a special customer (the little blue figure) who wants to talk poetry with everyone here!

I’ve given every ordinary customer unique identity traits, and they will chat with you using DeepSeek (Friendly reminder: if this doesn’t work, it might be because you’re using a VPN). After hearing their stories, you can write a poem for them.

Sitting in the lower right corner is a special character—the tavern’s resident poet. Currently, the resident poet is a young poet named Wang Zigua, but he might be replaced by someone else in a few days. By talking to the resident poet, he will share a few lines of poetry he once wrote with you. You can also write a poem for him.

In the current version, all the poems you write in the tavern will be stored in the cloud. When you’ve written enough poems, you might even take a seat in that corner as the resident poet.

Enjoy poetry!

梅隆的诗歌酒馆1.0.2版本正式发布！让我们一起庆祝圣诞节！

这个版本稍微升级了视觉体验、增加、修改了不少细节。最大的更新是引入了云端数据库：当玩家通过与NPC互动、写诗，所写的诗歌会自动上传到云端，并展示在游戏中的诗歌图书馆里。

【！！注意！！】
1. 目前还没有正式的用户登录系统，因此诗歌的作者信息全凭大家自己输入自己的名字。
2. 目前没有给用户删除数据的权限，因此如果实在想要删除自己发布的诗，可以联系我。

================

欢迎来到梅隆的诗歌酒馆（Melon's Poetry Tavern）。这是一个目前还很粗糙的桌面放置小游戏。打开网页，你可以看到一个忙碌的小酒馆，你的任务不是调酒、赚钱、雇佣服务员、扩张……而是作为一个特别的顾客（蓝色的小人），你想要和这里的所有人谈谈诗歌！

1. 我给每个普通顾客设置了身份特性，它们将使用deepseek与你交谈（友情提示：如果不能使用，可能是因为你开了VPN），你可以在听了他们的故事之后为他们写一首诗。

2. 右下角坐着一位特殊人物，他是这家酒店的驻店诗人。最近，驻店诗人是一位叫王子瓜的青年诗人，过几天也许会换成其他人。通过与驻店诗人交谈，他会把他曾经写过的几句诗送给你。你也可以为他写一首诗。

3. 在目前的版本中，你在酒馆里写的所有诗都将存储在云端，并且当你的诗已经足够多，你也可能作为驻店诗人坐在那个角落。

享受诗歌吧！
